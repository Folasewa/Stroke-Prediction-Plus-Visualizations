# Stroke-Prediction-Plus-Visualizations
Just got my hands on a Kaggle Dataset on stroke prediction giving the health parameters and indicators.
This project required me to clean my data, make some visualizations using the health indicators on the dataset to infer which leads to stroke. 
Then, after the visualizations, I used some machine learning models to make predictions. The model with 98% accuracy was used.
